Brothers Day Special Project
This project is a personalized web application designed to celebrate Brothers Day, offering dynamic messages and a carousel of cherished memories. It's built to be interactive and visually appealing, allowing for a unique tribute to a brother (or a brother-sister bond).

Features
Multi-Page Navigation: The application is structured into three distinct sections:

Introduction Page: A welcoming screen to start the tribute.

Dynamic Messages Page: Displays a series of heartfelt or humorous messages that can be cycled through.

Cherished Memories Page: Features a horizontal carousel of images and descriptions, showcasing memorable moments.

Dynamic Backgrounds: Users can change the background gradient of the application with a click of a button, offering a variety of aesthetic choices.

Responsive Design: The layout is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a great experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Smooth Animations: Subtle CSS animations and transitions are used for page changes, memory carousel scrolling, and button interactions, enhancing the user experience.

Image Fallback: Includes an onerror attribute for memory images, displaying a placeholder if an image fails to load.

Keyboard Navigation: The memory carousel can also be navigated using the left and right arrow keys.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the basic structure and content of the web pages.

CSS3: For styling and visual presentation, including custom scrollbars and page animations.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid and responsive UI development.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all interactive elements, dynamic content loading, page navigation, and background switching.
